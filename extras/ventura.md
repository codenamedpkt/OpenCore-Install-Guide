## Prerequisites

### Supported SMBIOS

SMBIOS dropped in Ventura:

* iMac17,x and older
* Macmini7,1 and older
* MacBook9,1 and older
* MacBookAir7,x and older
* MacBookPro13,x and older
* MacPro6,1 and older

If your SMBIOS was supported in Monterey and is not included above, you're good to go!

::: details Supported SMBIOS

* iMac18,x and newer
* MacPro7,1 and newer
* iMacPro1,1 and newer
* Macmini8,1
* MacBook10,1
* MacBookAir8,1 and newer
* MacBookPro14,x and newer

[Click here](./smbios-support.md) for a full list of supported SMBIOS.

<!-- FIXTHIS

For those on Haswell or Ivy Bridge, here are some simple conversions:

* Ivy Bridge desktops with dGPU should use MacPro6,1
* Haswell desktops with dGPU should use iMac17,1
* Haswell desktops with only an iGPU should use iMac16,2
* Haswell laptops should use MacBookPro11,4 or MacBookPro11,5

-->

### Supported hardware

Dropped GPU Hardware:

* Haswell (HD 4200/4400/4600/5000/P4600/P4700, Iris 5100, Iris Pro 5200)
* Broadwell (HD 5300/5500/5600/6000/P5700, Iris 6100, Iris Pro 6200/P6300)
* Skylake (HD 5xx/P5xx, Iris 5xx, Iris Pro 5xx/P5xx)
  * Skylake can be spoofed as Kaby Lake with WhateverGreen v1.6.1 and up
  * Change your `device-id` and `AAPL,ig-platform-id` to the most similar Kaby Lake model
  * If using the same EFI to boot Monterey and below, add `-igfxsklaskbl` to your boot args
<!--

OCLP is not supported yet

* You can use [OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/) to add back support
  * No support is provided for Hackintoshes using OCLP!
  * You will lose access to non-full updates (Small 1-3GB updates)
  * Requires SIP, Apple Secure Boot, and AMFI disabled.
-->

### AMD Patches

For those on AMD CPUs, make sure to update your [kernel patches](https://github.com/AMD-OSX/AMD_Vanilla) for Ventura.
Don't forget to update your patches as well with the core count of your CPU.
The patches which need to be edited are all named `algrey - Force cpuid_cores_per_package`, and you only need to change the `Replace` value. You should change:

* `B8000000 0000` => `B8 <core count> 0000 0000`
* `BA000000 0000` => `BA <core count> 0000 0000`
* `BA000000 0090` => `BA <core count> 0000 0090`

Where `<core count>` is replaced with the physical core count of your CPU in hexadecimal. For example, an 8-Core 5800X would have the new Replace value be:

* `B8 08 0000 0000`
* `BA 08 0000 0000`
* `BA 08 0000 0090`

::: details Core Count => Hexadecimal Table

| Core Count | Hexadecimal |
| :--------- | :---------- |
| 4 Core | `04` |
| 6 Core | `06` |
| 8 Core | `08` |
| 12 Core | `0C` |
| 16 Core | `10` |
| 24 Core | `18` |
| 32 Core | `20` |
| 64 Core | `40` |
